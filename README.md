# Web GL Project

This is a simple project I did for my WebGL course.

# Interactions

You can click in the scene to add a knife on the wolf (yes I know it's really strange but I had no idea what to do ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯)

# Commands
```sh
$ npm install 
$ npx http-server
```
You can now go on ``localhost:8080`` to see my project.

HAVE FUN ! (this is clearly not fun at all)
